# Validation System

The React Flow Rule Engine includes a comprehensive validation system that provides real-time feedback on your rule configurations, helping you identify and fix issues before they cause problems.

## Validation Panel

Located in the top-right corner of the interface, the validation panel continuously monitors your flow for errors and warnings.

### Features

- **Real-time Validation**: Continuously checks your flow for errors
- **Error Categories**: Different types of validation errors
- **Clickable Errors**: Click errors to highlight problematic nodes
- **Collapsible Interface**: Expand/collapse to save space

## Error Types

### Cycle Detection üîÑ

**What it is**: Detects circular connections in your flow

**Why it matters**: Prevents infinite loops in rule execution

**How to fix**: Remove circular connections between nodes

**Example**: If Node A connects to Node B, and Node B connects back to Node A

### Disconnected Nodes üîå

**What it is**: Nodes that aren't properly connected

**Why it matters**: Ensures all nodes are part of the flow

**How to fix**: Connect disconnected nodes or remove unused ones

**Note**: Some nodes can be standalone (like Initial Node)

### Operator Input Errors ‚ö†Ô∏è

**What it is**: Operators with incorrect number of inputs

**Why it matters**: Ensures logical operators work correctly

**How to fix**: Connect appropriate number of inputs to operators

**Examples**:

- AND operator needs at least 2 inputs
- OR operator needs at least 2 inputs
- NOT operator needs exactly 1 input

### Invalid Connections ‚ùå

**What it is**: Connections between incompatible node types

**Why it matters**: Prevents runtime errors

**How to fix**: Connect only compatible node types

**Examples**:

- Don't connect Initial Node directly to Action Node
- Don't connect Action Node to Condition Node

## Validation Indicators

### Visual Indicators

- **Red Icons**: Show on nodes with errors
- **Hover Tooltips**: Display error details
- **Click to Focus**: Click error indicators to highlight issues

### Node Highlighting

- **Red Border**: Nodes with validation errors
- **Green Border**: Selected nodes (Rule Groups)
- **Error Icons**: Small red icons on problematic nodes

## Validation Status

### Status Indicators

- **‚úÖ Valid**: Green checkmark - all validations passed
- **‚ùå Invalid**: Red X - errors need to be fixed
- **Summary**: Shows error count and status

### Status Messages

- "All Validations Passed" - No errors found
- "X errors found" - Shows number of errors
- "Validating..." - System is checking for errors

## Using the Validation System

### Real-time Monitoring

The validation system runs continuously in the background, checking your flow as you make changes.

### Error Resolution

1. **Check the Validation Panel** - Look for error messages
2. **Click on Errors** - Click error messages to highlight problematic nodes
3. **Fix the Issues** - Address the specific problems mentioned
4. **Re-validate** - The system will automatically re-check after changes

### Best Practices

- **Check Frequently**: Monitor the validation panel regularly
- **Fix Errors Early**: Address issues as soon as they appear
- **Understand Error Types**: Learn what each error type means
- **Use Visual Indicators**: Pay attention to red borders and error icons

## Common Validation Scenarios

### Scenario 1: Empty Workflow

- **Error**: "No Initial Node found"
- **Fix**: Add an Initial Node to start your workflow

### Scenario 2: Unconnected Nodes

- **Error**: "Disconnected nodes detected"
- **Fix**: Connect nodes to the main flow or remove unused ones

### Scenario 3: Circular Logic

- **Error**: "Cycle detected in flow"
- **Fix**: Remove the circular connection

### Scenario 4: Incomplete Configuration

- **Error**: "Node has incomplete configuration"
- **Fix**: Fill in all required fields in the node

## Troubleshooting Validation Issues

### Validation Panel Not Showing

- **Cause**: Panel might be collapsed
- **Solution**: Click the expand arrow in the validation panel header
- **Location**: Top-right corner of the interface

### Errors Not Clearing

- **Cause**: Changes not saved or cached
- **Solution**: Make sure all changes are applied and saved
- **Check**: Ensure all required fields are filled

### False Positives

- **Cause**: System might be checking against strict rules
- **Solution**: Review the error message and adjust your flow accordingly
- **Note**: Some warnings might be acceptable depending on your use case

## Advanced Validation

### Custom Validation Rules

The system includes built-in validation rules for:

- Node connectivity
- Data type compatibility
- Required field validation
- Logical flow validation

### Performance Considerations

- Validation runs in real-time
- Large flows may take longer to validate
- System optimizes validation for performance
- Errors are cached to improve responsiveness
