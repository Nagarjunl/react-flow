# Getting Started

Welcome to the React Flow Rule Engine! This guide will help you get up and running quickly.

## First Steps

### 1. Open the Application

Launch the React Flow Rule Engine in your browser or development environment.

### 2. Start with Initial Node

Every workflow begins with an Initial Node. This is your starting point.

### 3. Name Your Workflow

Enter a descriptive name for your workflow (e.g., "Commission Rules", "Bonus Calculation").

### 4. Build Your Rules

Add condition and action nodes to define your business logic.

### 5. Validate & Export

Use the validation panel to check for errors and export your configuration.

## Understanding the Interface

The React Flow Rule Engine interface consists of several key areas:

- **Sidebar** (Left): Control panel with buttons to add nodes and manage workflows
- **Flow Area** (Center): Main workspace where you build your rule flows
- **Validation Panel** (Top-right): Real-time error checking and validation
- **Minimap** (Bottom-right): Overview and navigation tool

## Basic Workflow

Here's a typical workflow for creating business rules:

1. **Create Initial Node** → Set workflow name
2. **Add Rule Groups** → Organize related rules
3. **Add Conditions** → Define business logic
4. **Add Operators** → Connect conditions with AND/OR/NOT
5. **Add Actions** → Define what happens when conditions are met
6. **Connect Nodes** → Link everything together
7. **Validate Flow** → Check for errors
8. **Generate JSON** → Export your configuration
