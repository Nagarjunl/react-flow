# Node Types

The React Flow Rule Engine provides several specialized node types, each designed for specific purposes in building business rules and workflows.

## 🚀 Initial Node

**Purpose**: Starting point of your workflow

### Configuration

- **Workflow Name**: Enter a descriptive name for your workflow
- **Validation**: Name is required (cannot be empty)

### Visual Indicators

- Blue gradient background
- Single bottom connection handle
- Red border if validation fails

### Usage Tips

- Always start your workflow with this node
- Use descriptive names like "Commission Calculation" or "Bonus Rules"

## 🔍 Condition Node

**Purpose**: Defines business logic conditions

### Configuration

#### 1. Table Selection

Choose from available tables:

- `metrics`: TargetAchievement, AttendancePercentage, StoreKpiAchievement, etc.
- `user`: Designation, Name, Id
- `sales`: Amount, Quantity, Date
- `orders`: id, customer_id, product_id, quantity, etc.
- `products`: id, name, price, category, stock_quantity
- `customers`: id, name, email, discount_rate, membership_level

#### 2. Field Selection

Choose specific field from selected table

#### 3. Expression

Select operator based on field type:

- **Numeric/Integer**: `>=`, `<=`, `=`, `>`, `<`, `!=`
- **Varchar**: contains, equals, starts with, ends with, `!=`
- **Date**: `>=`, `<=`, `=`, `>` (after), `<` (before), `!=`

#### 4. Value

Enter the comparison value

### Visual Indicators

- Red gradient background
- Input/output connection handles
- Red border if validation fails

### Usage Tips

- Field selection updates based on table selection
- Expression options change based on field type
- Use appropriate value formats (numbers for numeric, text for varchar)

## ⚡ Action Node

**Purpose**: Defines what happens when conditions are met

### Configuration

#### 1. Action Type

Choose from:

- `onTarget`: When target is achieved
- `onSuccess`: When operation succeeds
- `onFailure`: When operation fails
- `onError`: When error occurs
- `onComplete`: When process completes

#### 2. Action Name

Enter descriptive name for the action

### Visual Indicators

- Teal gradient background
- Input/output connection handles
- Red border if validation fails

### Usage Tips

- Use descriptive action names
- Choose appropriate action types for your business logic

## 🔗 Conditional Operator Node

**Purpose**: Connects multiple conditions with logical operators

### Configuration

- **Operator**: Choose from AND, OR, NOT

### Visual Indicators

- Orange gradient background
- Multiple connection handles
- Red border if validation fails

### Usage Tips

- **AND**: All conditions must be true
- **OR**: At least one condition must be true
- **NOT**: Inverts the condition result

## 📦 Rule Group Node

**Purpose**: Container for organizing related rules

### Configuration

- **Label**: Enter group name
- **Resizable**: Can be resized by dragging corners

### Visual Indicators

- Purple gradient background
- Green border when selected
- Can contain child nodes

### Usage Tips

- Use groups to organize complex rule logic
- Click to select group for adding child nodes
- Resize to accommodate multiple child nodes

## Node Connection Rules

### Valid Connections

- Initial Node → Rule Group
- Rule Group → Condition Node
- Rule Group → Operator Node
- Condition Node → Operator Node
- Operator Node → Action Node
- Condition Node → Action Node

### Invalid Connections

- Initial Node → Action Node (direct)
- Action Node → Condition Node
- Operator Node → Initial Node

## Best Practices

### Node Organization

- Use Rule Groups to organize related conditions
- Keep conditions logically grouped
- Use operators to combine multiple conditions
- Connect actions to the final result of your logic

### Naming Conventions

- Use descriptive names for all nodes
- Include context in workflow names
- Make action names specific and clear
- Use consistent naming patterns

### Visual Layout

- Arrange nodes in logical flow (top to bottom)
- Use Rule Groups to contain related nodes
- Keep connections clean and avoid crossing lines
- Use the minimap to navigate large flows
