when more than one Condition Node
This is main part it have some complex logic.

first we have create a valid groups based on "edges connection to the Operator Node" and apply the rules on those groups.

For example in a single Rule Group Node have

1.  Two or more than Two condition nodes are connected to one Operator Node. - this is a group.

2.  Two Condition Node connected to one Operator Node and another Two Condition Node connected to one Operator Node. here we have two groups.

    first group: Condition1 and Condition2 with OR Operator.
    second group: Condition3 and Condition4 with And Operator.

these are valid groups

3. Two Condition Node connected to one Operator Node and another Two Condition Node connected to one Operator Node. finally those two Operator Node connected to one Operator Node. Here

   first group: Condition1 and Condition2 with OR Operator.
   second group: Condition3 and Condition4 with And Operator.

   first and second are valid groups(STRICTLY). then only check the following :
   first Groups OR Operator Node and second Groups AND Operator Node connected to NOT Operator Node. this is also valid group.

   here final expression result is : (Condition1 OR Condition2) NOT (Condition3 AND Condition4)

4. Valid Groups with Multiple Conditions:

   - Group 1: Multiple conditions → Single operator (e.g., Condition1 + Condition2 + Condition3 → OR operator)
   - Group 2: Multiple conditions → Single operator (e.g., Condition3 + Condition4 → AND operator)
   - Any operator type from the Operator node (OR, AND, NOT, etc.)

5. Group Validation Rule:

   - Only when a group is valid, then only the Multiple operators from group → Single operator
   - Invalid groups cannot be combined with other groups

6. Default Operator Rule:

   - When two valid groups exist without a third operator connecting them, the default operator is AND

   Example:

   - Group 1: (user.Name Equals 45 AND user.Name Equals 66)
   - Group 2: (user.Name Equals YYYY OR products.price Less than 1000)
   - If no third operator connects them → Default: (user.Name Equals 45 AND user.Name Equals 66) AND (user.Name Equals YYYY OR products.price Less than 1000)

Note: This same logic applies to both Rule Groups AND Action Groups.
